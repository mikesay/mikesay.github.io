### AlertManager
+ Whatâ€™s the difference between group_interval, group_wait, and repeat_interval?

    https://www.robustperception.io/whats-the-difference-between-group_interval-group_wait-and-repeat_interval

    + group_wait  
    How long to wait to buffer alerts of the same group before sending a notification initially.

    + group_interval  
    How long to wait before sending an alert that has been added to a group for which there has already been a notification.

    
    + repeat_interval  
    How long to wait before re-sending a given alert that has already been sent in a notification.

+ Silence alert in the config file of AlertManager

```bash
route:
  # Other settings...
  group_wait: 0s
  group_interval: 1m
  repeat_interval: 1h

  # Default receiver.
  receiver: "null"

  routes:
  # continue defaults to false, so the first match will end routing.
  - match:
      # This was previously named DeadMansSwitch
      alertname: Watchdog
    receiver: "null"
  - match:
      alertname: CPUThrottlingHigh
    receiver: "null"
  - receiver: "regular_alert_receiver"

receivers:
  - name: "null"
  - name: regular_alert_receiver

### Prometheus

+ What's the difference between scrape_interval and evaluation_interval?

    + scrape_interval  
    The time between each Prometheus scrape (i.e when Prometheus is pulling data from exporters etc.).
    
    + evaluation_interval  T
    he time between each evaluation of Prometheus' alerting rules.

### Prometheus Operator

https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator  

#### Limit of Promethues Operator
+ Do not support HA. Promethues Operator was developed earlier than operator-sdk, so it didn't enjoy the out-of-box HA ability of operator-sdk. It needs to use the LeaderElection mechanism of client-go explicitly, which has already been integrated by operator-sdk.

### kube-prometheus
https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus  

This repository collects Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.
