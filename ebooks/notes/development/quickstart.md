+ NginX: Serve application under sub path  
    https://serverfault.com/questions/1101045/nginx-serve-application-under-sub-path  

    Generally running the app under an URI prefix when the app itself does not expect it is a tricky thing, and the only reliable solution would be to fix/setup the app making it generate all the assets/routes links either relative or including the prefix it is deployed under. Almost every existing workarounds are to rewrite the application responses "on-the-fly" replacing generated links with the new ones. Some kind of a generic answer is here, some additional considerations can be found here.
